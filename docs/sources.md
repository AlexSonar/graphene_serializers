How to serialize a Django model using Graphene-Django outside the context of a graphQL query

Basically, I'm looking for a Graphene analogue to using a DRF serializer
[DRF serializer](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/#serializing-objects)

[Queries & ObjectTypes](https://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/django/en/latest/queries/)

[graphql-go](https://github.com/graphql-go/graphql)
